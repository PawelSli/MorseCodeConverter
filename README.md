The application accepts all Latin characters, Polish diacritics, special characters and Arabic numerals 
when translating to Morse code. During reverse translation only full stop, vertical dash and white characters are accepted. 
If these requirements are not met, the translation is blocked until the error is corrected and a message is displayed to inform the user of the problem.
